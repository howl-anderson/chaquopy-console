# Chaquopy flask service app

This is an example of an flask (https://github.com/pallets/flask) web service running in an Android app using
[Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/). Some starting points:

* The example Python script is in 
  `app/src/main/python/main.py`.
  You can replace this with your own code.
* The Android activity which hosts it is in 
  `app/src/main/java/com/chaquo/python/console/MainActivity.java`.
* The Chaquopy configuration is in 
  `app/build.gradle`.
* The `requirements.txt` is in
  `app/src/requirements.txt`
